    "Mandatory assignment 3 is about the practical use of Large Language Models (LLMs). More specifically, you will be tasked to implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system able to answer factual questions based on a document database, more specifically Wiki pages extracted from an [online Star Wars encyclopedia](https://starwars.fandom.com). \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"> <b>Practical setup:</b> The preferred way to complete this assignment is using the high-performance computing cluster <i>Fox</i>. See <a href=\"https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN4080/h24/computing-setup.html\">here</a> for instructions on how to register and log in to Fox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you cannot work on Fox, you can do the assignment on your machine. In this case, make sure you have installed the following libraries: `pytorch`, `transformers`, `huggingface_hub`,  `bm25s`, `sentence-transformers` and either `nltk` or `spacy` (depending on how you prefer to do sentence splitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Gemma LLMs (from Google) are [_gated_](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-gated), you will also need to:\n",
    "- create a user account on HuggingFace\n",
    "- access the user conditions for [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-1.1-2b-it)\n",
    "- Create an acces token ([here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens))\n",
    "- At the start of your notebook, run the following code: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from huggingface_hub import login\n",
    "login(token=\"hf_...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "You should deliver a completed version of this Jupyter notebook, containing both your code and explanations about the steps you followed. We want to stress that simply submitting code is __not__ by itself sufficient to complete the assignment - we expect the notebook to also contain explanations of what you have implemented, along with motivations for the choices you made along the way. Preferably use whole sentences, and mathematical formulas if necessary. Explaining in your own words (using concepts we have covered through in the lectures) what you have implemented and reflecting on your solution is an important part of the learning process - take it seriously!\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the use of LLMs (ChatGPT or similar): you are allowed to use them as 'sparring partner', for instance to clarify something you have not understood. However, you are __not__ allowed to use them to generate solutions (either in part or in full) to the assignment tasks. \n"

Niima Outpost was the only spaceport on the planet, although it was referred more as a landing field rather than a spaceport.Rey's Survival Guide Scavengers, like Rey, salvaged materials from the technology leftover from the Battle of Jakku. Salvage made up the backbone of the economy, but other branches such as black market trading, mercenaries for hire, and other unlawful activities exist.  Niima's fuel supplies were basic, though there were some scavengers who located military grade supplies, such as rhydonium. Niima attracted a lot of attention offworld because of it being the only navigational beacon on the planet. These foreigners were encouraged to lock up their ships. Most travelers opted to sleep on their ships due to lack of permanent structures in the outpost. Scavengers brought their finds to Niima Outpost in exchange for supplies from Unkar Plutt, the local boss who operated from the center of awning-roofed blockhouse known as the Concession Stand. Niima Outpost was also the location of Constable Zuvio's office. The outpost's main gate utilized architecture akin to that found on other Hutt worlds such as Teth. Sarco Plank opened a gun shop at the outpost to modify and enhance blasters.  The outpost was attacked by the First Order, who were looking for the astromech droid BB-8 and stormtrooper defector Finn.\n",

      "- Niima, also known as Niima the Hutt, was an enterprising female Hutt scoundrel who operated far from the borders of Hutt Space, a province of the galaxy that became embroiled in conflict as the Hutts attempted to carve up the deceased crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure's territory. Niima resided in a temple on the desert planet of Jakku. Prior to the Battle of Jakku, Niima struck a deal with Gallius Rax, the Counselor to the Empire, to guard the pass to the Plaintive Hand plateau and kidnap local orphans in return for receiving weapons. Later, Rae Sloane struck a deal with Niima to gain access to the Jakku Observatory, claiming that it hid a powerful weapon there.  Niima was later wounded when Rax ambushed her convoy and captured Sloane and Brentin Lore Wexley. Despite being wounded, Niima survived with the help of the bounty hunter Jas Emari, who ferried her back to her temple. Following the Battle of Jakku, Niima monopolized the salvage collection efforts on Jakku and established Niima Outpost. Though Niima was later killed by a bounty hunter, Niima Outpost continued to bear her name. It was rumored that a group who worshiped the Hutts as gods constructed their village around the cranial mantle of Niima herself, gilded in precious metals and covered with jewels, following her demise.\n",
